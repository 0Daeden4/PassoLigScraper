# Motivation

Since it is (sometimes) hard to find any tickets for upcoming football matches, I was compelled to explore how this process can be automated or at 
least how it could be made more easy to find any tickets.
This project was made as an experiment and it is a learning experience for me.


# Features

Since I am still not familliar with how the server communicates with the client and vice versa as of making this project, the program can only get 
the data for available seats for all the upcoming matches presented in the [website](https://www.passo.com.tr/). The data is then extracted to a 
.txt file. The program also shows the category of seats, where the most amount of seats are available.


## Issues

The authorization token in the GET header seems to get occasionally re-generated by the website and it is required to use the most recent token to 
access the most (some might still get fetched without getting 401) amount of data.

## TODO

- Find a way of working around the authorization token
- Automatically buy tickets as soon as the sales panel is open for the user
- Work with output string formatting
- Make the code more readable (re-format it)
